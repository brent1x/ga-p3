# RezQ

RezQ notifies you when a table at your favorite restaurant becomes available. Give us some times on the date you’d like to get a table and we’ll continually monitor the restaurant’s inventory.

RezQ is our final student project at General Assembly’s 12-week Web Development bootcamp. We used the following technologies to solve this problem:

- Ruby + Rails for the backend
- Mobile-friendly HTML5 on the frontend
- Bootstrap + The Noun Project for sweetness
- Nokogiri for parsing web pages
- Javascript + Mechanize.js for automation (currently not implemented)
- Ruby’s Whenever gem for scheduling
- Twilio for sending text notifications

In case our app gets blocked (or the website we’re crawling changes something on their frontend), we’ve archived a video at [] showcasing the functionality of RezQ.
